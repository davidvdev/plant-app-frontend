# My Plant App - Plantie

## Description
Plantie is the perfect application for reminding users when to water their beloved plants by creating a daily to do list. The user has the ability to add as many new plants to their collection as they desire and our app will set up a schedule that will let the user know which plants they should water. Plantie takes full advantage of user authentication and requires a username and password in order to enter the site. Usernames and passwords are created free of charge and does not require any personal information.

Our app uses a third party API to populate a local database that is manipulated to provide extra details, information, and images of tropical fruits and vegetables. Once the user adds plants to their collection they have the ability to edit details about each specific plant and can delete the plant entirely. Plantie is built using React with a mobile first responsive design that is focused on the user experience.
